                Hello 
                My name is Rubival Santos, but my friends call me Rubinho Lima. This is also how I am known at work. 
                I own a production logistics company specialized in TV shows called Atrium Solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                At age 22 I graduated with a bachelors degree in Computer Science at Universidade Salvador, in Brazil. 
                My first employment experience was with the IT department of Emilio Odebrecht Foundation, a well-known organization in Brazil. 
                After just a few months of employment, I was selected to work for a local TV station called TV Bahia, in the IT support area. 
                While there I used to spend my lunch break everyday near the journalism production department. I gradually used my computer 
                skills to improve the broadcasting of evening news stories throughout the State of Bahia.
            </p>

            <p>
                My work was soon recognized and I was transferred to the largest television network in Brazil. 
                I spent most of my career in Brazil working for Rede Globo. There I worked with the production of soap operas, 
                entertainment and sports shows, as well as the transmission of soccer matches and F-1 races. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2000 I moved with my family to the United States where I continued to work with production logistics.

            </p>

            <p>
                As I grew older and more experienced, I decided that it was time to return to my professional origins. 
                So today I am back at school to study Computer Programming. I am very pleased to be part of a reputable university, 
                studying what I like and feeling blessed to have all the support of the teachers, TA's, the staff. With their support 
                I will reach my career goals. I can only be grateful and be proud of it!
